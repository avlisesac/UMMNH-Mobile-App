  blurb: `The mother and baby *Dolichorhynchops* (doll-ick-or-INK-ops) depicted here are plesiosaurs, swimming reptiles that descended from those on land. Our exhibit paints a picture of a feeding frenzy in a sea that covered much of western North America about 80 million years ago.`,
  fullText: `*Dolichorhynchops* was a short-necked plesiosaur that lived near the end of the Cretaceous period. It grew to be 12-15 feet long and lived in shallow seas that covered what is now much of western North America. Plesiosaurs were a group of ancient marine reptiles that could make deep dives, but because they couldn’t breathe underwater, they had to come up for air.

Our mural displays a mother and baby *Dolichorhynchops*. Like all plesiosaurs, they didn’t lay eggs, and they’re thought to have had only one baby at a time. Like whales and dolphins, some scientists think that since they gave birth to only one baby, *Dolichorhynchops* may have invested more parental care than reptiles that birthed many young as eggs.

Accompanying the *Dolichorhynchops* are other animals that have come to feed on the school of *Diplomystus*. Swarming masses of fish like this one are called bait balls--they attract many different predators, all showing up to take advantage of the large amount of food. *Cimolichthys* (see-mole-IKTH-iss) was a predatory fish that lived in shallow seas. *Hesperornis* (hess-purr-OR-niss) was a flightless sea bird that used its powerful back legs to dive through the water and caught fish with its toothy beak.

      q: `Can you find something in *Dolichorhynchops* skull that makes it clearly different from Dinosaurs?`,
      a: `Like all Plesiosaurs, *Dolichorhynchops* has only one hole behind the eye. This is different from all Dinosaurs, which had two of these holes. If you want to impress someone with your knowledge of fossils, these holes are called “post-orbital fenestra”`
    },
    {
      q: `How many different kinds of dinosaurs are in this mural?`,
      a: `Only one! The *Hesperornis* (the diving bird) is the only dinosaur shown here. Did you know that all birds are classified as dinosaurs? The rest of the animals here are fish, Plesiosaurs, and Pterosaurs.`
    },
    {
      q: `Can you think of any modern day animal that behaves and lives similarly to the *Dolichorhynchops*?`,
      a: `Penguins have a similar body shape that allows for powerful swimming. They both make deep dives but have to return to the surface. They both swallow their food (fish) whole. The main difference being that Penguins can go on to land, where *Dolichorhynchops* could not.`
