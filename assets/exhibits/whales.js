  blurb: `These two whales come from the Sahara desert in Egypt and lived around 37 million years ago when parts of northern Africa were covered by ocean. They are some of the earliest whales that spent their whole lives in the water. Their small back legs show an evolutionary link to land-living mammal ancestors. Whales are artiodactyls that evolved to live in water. Their closest modern relatives are things like hippos, camels, and deer.`,
  fullText: `The two whales hanging from the ceiling of the museum represent two of the earliest examples of fully aquatic whales. The earliest whales had legs instead of flippers and spent part of their life on dry land.

*Dorudon* (DORE-uh-don) is the smaller skeleton on display. It, or something similar, is thought to be the ancestor of all modern whales. This specimen is from Egypt, and lived about 37 million years ago.

*Basilosaurus* (bass-ill-oh-SORE-us) is the larger skeleton. They grew up to 55–65 feet long—as long as a modern humpback whale. Our *Basilosaurus* is a 45-foot-long female found in Egypt. *Basilosaurus* lived with *Dorudon* in the sea that covered Egypt 37 million years ago. In fact, *Basilosaurus* probably preyed on young *Dorudon*.

In both *Dorudon* and *Basilosaurus*, you can observe the whales’ vestigial hind limbs. These tiny legs didn’t help them move around. In fact, we’re not sure how the whales used them. They’re evolutionary remnants inherited from earlier whales that had powerful back legs to propel themselves through the water. Modern whales don’t have legs, but they do often have small vestigial hip bones—remnants of these vestigial legs! Whale fossils show the evolutionary transition from four-legged land mammals to flippered aquatic mammals without hind limbs.

      q: `Why do you think the *Basilosaurus* fossil is colored so vibrantly?`,
      a: `When fossils are formed, the minerals in the sediment around them slowly replace the organic material of the bones. This *Basilosaurus* is orange because it was buried in an iron-rich environment.`
    },
    {
      q: `Why did scientists decide to position our two whales the way they are?`,
      a: `There is evidence that the larger *Basilosaurus* preyed on the juvenile *Dorudon*. Whether hunted or scavenged on, there are marks of *Basilosaurus* teeth on *Dorudon* skulls. For that reason, the skeletons are positioned to display this relationship.`
    },
    {
      q: `Can you spot any similarities between these whale skeletons and your own?`,
      a: `There are many! One notable similarity is in the whales’ front legs, or flippers. If you observe carefully, the structure is very similar to your arm! Both consist of a Humerus (upper arm), Radius and Ulna (forearm), Carpals (wrist), Metacarpals (hand), and Phalanges (fingers).`
