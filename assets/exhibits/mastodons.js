  blurb: 'Hailing from Chelsea, Michigan, the Bristle Mammoth was unearthed in 2015 on the Bristle farm. The Bristle Mammoth is an exciting specimen of a Jeffersonian mammoth (M. jeffersonii), a hybrid species of the northern woolly mammoth and the southern Columbian mammoth. It originally measured about 13 feet tall and weighed nearly 8 tons! Though large and imposing with its giant, curved tusks, this mammoth was an herbivore and spent much of its time grazing.',
  fullText: `Mammoths came to North America from Asia, across the Bering land bridge. Jeffersonian mammoths like this one had thick, protective hair, similar to woolly mammoths. They used their large tusks for fighting, as well as to help forage for food.

The Bristle Mammothâ€™s primary habitat was quite cold and arid. They grazed on the grasses and sedges that grew in cold environments. Mammoths used their tusks to move snow and other objects in order to find more food.

So what caused the extinction of mammoths? Scientists have several ideas. Like the American mastodon, it is proposed that environmental factors leading to food loss combined with being over-hunted by early humans were the leading causes of the extinction of the mammoth.`,
