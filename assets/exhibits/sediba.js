  blurb: `*Australopithecus sediba* (awe-struh-low-PITH-ih-kiss said-EE-buh) is a great example of why we refer to evolution in terms of ‘trees of life’ and not ‘ladders of life.’ While *Australopithecus sediba* is an ape that is very similar to humans, it is probably not a direct ancestor. It could be thought of as an evolutionary cousin—a member of a separate, parallel branch on the tree of human evolution.`,
  fullText: `*Australopithecus sediba* is a human relative that lived 1.98 million years ago. Although it is not likely a direct ancestor to modern humans, there are many similarities. Modern humans and *Australopithecus sediba* may have both evolved from something like *Australopithecus afarensis*, a species that lived about three million years ago. The skeleton called “Lucy” displayed next to *Australopithecus sediba* is the most complete specimen of *Australopithecus afarensis*.

Comparison of the bone structure of *Australopithecus sediba’s* feet with modern apes suggests that *A. sediba* probably walked on the outside edges of their feet and spent some time living in trees.

Our model of *Australopithecus sediba* is a life-size sculpture made by Daynès Studio in Paris, France. Ours is the first full-body model of an adult female. The species was discovered in 2010, in South Africa. The skeleton mounted next to the model is a cast skeleton reconstructed from bones of a few individuals. Some of the bones are thought to be from an adult female, others from an adolescent male. The brown colored bones show the extent of the fossil material that has been found, while the white bones are reconstructions.

      q: `Why do you think some of the bones on the *A. sediba* skeleton are a different color than the rest?`,
      a: `The yellow-brown bones are bones that were actually found, while the white bones are reconstructions based on the recovered pieces.`

    {
      q: `Using the skull wall to the right of *A. sediba*, which species had the largest brow?`,
      a: `Contrary to many common depictions of Neanderthals, they had a smaller brow than Homo Sapiens. That means that we actually have the largest brow of all!`
    },
    {
      q: `What are some differences you can observe between *Australopithecus sediba’s* skeleton and the skeleton of modern humans?`,
      a: `Compared to modern humans, *Australopithecus sediba* was considerably shorter as well as stockier. Their skull was much smaller than our own, meaning that their brain was also smaller. This limited brain size means that while they were likely able to craft simple tools, they did not have any higher-level brain functions.`
