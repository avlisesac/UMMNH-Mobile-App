## Italics

Use the CustomText component (can be found in the components folder) along with asterisks (*) to create italicized text. This is usually used for scientific names in the tour text or image gallery text. Currently only set up for default unstyled fonts.

ex: "The \*homo sapien\* was really cool" becomes:
"The *homo sapien* was really cool"
