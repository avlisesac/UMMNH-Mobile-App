  blurb: `Soaring high in the hair, *Quetzalcoatlus northropi* (ketts-all-koh-AHT-uh-liss NORTH-rop-eye), we can imagine this huge flying animal looking like a small plane in the skies of the late Cretaceous. Like other pterosaurs, it lived at the time of the dinosaurs, but was not a dinosaur itself. It may have hunted on land, stalking prey like a stork, or swooped down to feed.`,
  fullText: `*Quetzalcoatlus* is a member of the azhdarchid family of pterosaurs. Azhdarchids are known for having small bodies, large wings, long necks, big heads, and long, toothless beaks. *Quetzalcoatlus* specifically is named after the Aztec feathered serpent god Quetzalcoatl.

*Quetzalcoatlus* and other giant azhdarchids were the largest flying animals that ever lived. They were as big as small planes when flying and as tall as giraffes when walking on land. Despite being so big, they were relatively light. At around 640 pounds, our hand-painted fiberglass model is probably heavier than *Quetzalcoatlus* was in life!

*Quetzalcoatlus* was set apart from other pterosaurs because it mostly lived inland as opposed to by the water, and was likely an opportunistic feeder. Unlike modern birds, pterosaurs used all four of their limbs to launch into flight. Modeling their flight, some scientists think *Quetzalcoatlus* was capable of flying long distances at speeds of up to 80 miles per hour!

      q: `How large do you think this massive creature’s wingspan is?`,
      a: `From tip to tip, the wings of our model are 33.5 feet across!`
    },
    {
      q: `What do you notice about the size of the *Quetzalcoatlus* head compared to its body?`,
      a: `Although our model’s proportions are theoretical, based on other discovered species, we think that its skull was nearly four times the length of its torso!`
    },
    {
      q: `How much of its time would you guess *Quetzalcoatlus* spent in the air?`,
      a: `Due to its size, *Quetzalcoatlus* would have used up a lot of energy launching into the air. Because of this, it would probably only take flight to evade danger, travel long distances, or search for food.`
